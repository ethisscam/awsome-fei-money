Frequently asked questions about FEI protocol

## Can I still get TRIBE if I don't choose preswap during Genesis?
Of caurse. You will get FEI and TRIBE as soon as Genesis ends. And Preswap is an optional choise for Genesis Group which allows you swap some of your FEI to TRIBE when the Uniswap liquidity pool(FEI/TRIBE) launchs. You can think preswap is a predefined auto swapping which allows FEI protocol helps you convert some of your FEI to TRIBE so that you don't have to do that mannually.

## Since FEI's price fluctates during the Genesis,how does it achieve everyone receives FEI at the same price?
It's a little different from traditional exchange platform where you pay ETH and get another token immediately. During the genesis, it will only accumulate ETH paid by users and doesn't mint FEI(means you will not get FEI in the price of you pay ETH). When the genesis ends buyers receive FEI according to their propotion of the total ETH paid. Let's say when the genesis ends you buy 10 ETH and there are total 100 ETH buying then you will receive (10/100)*(the supply of FEI).

Someone maybe want to ask more:so what's the meaning of FEI's price fluctating during the genesis? Actually it affects the supply of FEI.

## Can I predict the price of FEI when Genesis ends?
Simply speaking it depends on how many ETH buyers paid and the ETH's price. If you want to learn more,here's a [good sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aWbQLYiHF6XV8dl3Vkv24NqFZlk332qpQSGjZbFGDJ0/edit#gid=0) showing all numbers and click them you will see the formula.
